Next steps:
1. Create a new branch following our naming convention:
   - feature/your-feature
   - bugfix/your-bugfix
   - hotfix/your-hotfix
   - release/version
   - ci/your-ci-change

2. Make your changes and commit. The pre-commit hooks will:
   - Run tests
   - Check code formatting
   - Validate commit messages
   - Ensure branch naming conventions
