Use your memory to remember what you have learned.
Use your sequential thinking tool if you cannot fix an issue in three attempts.
Use gitpython for all git operations. Here is the API reference: https://gitpython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference.html
Use idiomatic Typer for CLI operations.
Use pytest for testing and be sure to use it idiomatically and completely.
Use "uv run pytest -v -s" for example to run installed dependencies via uv. This way no virtual environment is needed.
Use the installed linters and formatters with the --fix or --write flag to automatically fix and format code before attempting to fix stuff yourself.
Aim for maximum maintainability.
Don't repeat yourself.
All our tests should adhere to the FIRST principle:
- Fast
- Isolated
- Repeatable
- Self-validating
- Timely
